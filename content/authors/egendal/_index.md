Ida was a DDSA PhD Fellow and Ph.D. student in statistics at Center for Clinical Data Science (CLINDA), Aalborg University and Aalborg University Hospital. Her work centered around mutational signatures and the clinical potential they possess, working towards advancing statistical methodologies for analyzing cancer-related mutations and their impact on clinical outcomes. Her focus was to develop an autoencoder-based alternative to non-negative matrix factorization for mutational signature extraction, under the hypothesis that the added model complexity will yield better and more robust estimates, suited for clinical use.
